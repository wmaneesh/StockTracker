Stock Tracker Plan

So our plan is to create a app that tracks the Major currency pairs that are traded daily on Forex. We will be using API's to pull in data
of each currency pair and then create Exponential or Simple moving averages to each pair. THe EMA or SMA will consist of a 10, 50 and 100 
line. When the price crosses the EMA or SMA the user will get a notification which pair crossed the EMA or SMA lines as well as which Line,
10 50 or 100 was crossed.
